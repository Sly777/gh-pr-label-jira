# Jira Fields as PR Labels

This action adds a few fields from Jira as a label on the pull request. Specifically, it will sync the following from Jira:

- Issue Type
- Priority
- Labels

Each PR label will have a specific prefix to clearly indicate what Jira field it represents.
By default all of the items mentioned above are synced, but you can turn off certain ones.

This action will cause the job to fail if a Jira issue key is not found as part of the pull request or if the issue key does not exist in Jira. To prevent this from failing the workflow, you can use the [`continue-on-error`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepscontinue-on-error) property offered by GitHub.

## Usage

Basic example

```yaml
name: My Pull Request Workflow

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, synchronize]

jobs:
  some_job_name:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: morficus/jira-issue-type-label
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          jira-api-token: ${{ secrets.JIRA_API_TOKEN }}
          jira-username: ${{ secrets.JIRA_USERNAME }}
          jira-base-url: ${{ secrets.JIRA_BASE_URL }}
```

By default, all fields specified above are synced, but you can also choose to not sync/skip certain ones.

```yaml
name: My Pull Request Workflow

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, synchronize]

jobs:
  some_job_name:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: morficus/jira-issue-type-label
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          jira-api-token: ${{ secrets.JIRA_API_TOKEN }}
          jira-username: ${{ secrets.JIRA_USERNAME }}
          jira-base-url: ${{ secrets.JIRA_BASE_URL }}
          sync-issue-labels: false
```

As a convenience, this action exposes a few properties on the Jira issue as outputs.
For a full list of outputs, see the "Output Options" section.

```yaml
name: My Pull Request Workflow

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, synchronize]

jobs:
  some_job_name:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - id: addLabel
        uses: morficus/jira-issue-type-label
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          jira-api-token: ${{ secrets.JIRA_API_TOKEN }}
          jira-username: ${{ secrets.JIRA_USERNAME }}
          jira-base-url: ${{ secrets.JIRA_BASE_URL }}

      - name: Print the issue key
        run: echo "${{ steps.addLabel.outputs.issue-key }}"
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
  <summary>How do I create a Jira API token?</summary>
  See Atlassian's official documentation: https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I create a GitHub API token?</summary>
  There is no need to do this manually. GitHub automatically provides/injects a token in every job that can be used for GitHub Actions. The default environment variable name is `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`.
You can check out the official GitHub documentation for more information about it: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I change the label colors?</summary>
  Sure you can! Once this action adds the label to the PR, you can change its color (or add a description) like you would any other label. You can check out the official GitHub documentation on how to do that: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels#editing-a-label
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Does this work with Jira Server (aka: on-prem)?</summary>
  Honestly, no clue. I don't have access to a Jira Server instance so I'm not able to test it.
But seeing how Atlassian is [ending support for it](https://www.atlassian.com/migration/assess/journey-to-cloud), there are no plans to support it.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Does this work with Jira Data Center edition?</summary>
  Honestly, no clue. I don't have access to a Jira Data Center instance so I'm not able to test it.
But if you do have access to one, I would not mind working together to get things working

## Future Functionality / Road Map

Here are a few things I want to add to this project over time

- [x] Option to sync labels from Jira to PR labels
- [x] Option to sync the issue priority from Jira to PR labels
- [ ] Option to add the Jira "fix version" as a "[Milestone](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones)" on the PR
- [ ] Option to add the Jira "sprint" as a "[Milestone](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones)" on the PR
- [ ] Ability to manage labels via a configuration file (this might end up being a different action)

## Inspiration

Inspiration for this action came from the following existing projects:

- [jira-description](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jira-description)
- [jira-lint](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jira-lint)
